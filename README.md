This framework provides a simple set of classes and modules to simplify
the process of deploying, in the Sali lab, a web service (a web-based front
end to jobs that run on the lab cluster). It is designed specifically for
the Sali lab environment, but can probably be adapted to run elsewhere
if desired.

See [the documentation](https://salilab.org/saliweb/) for more information
on using this framework.

For users in the Sali lab, the framework is already set up - nothing further
needs to be done. To use outside of the lab, see
the relevant [section in the documentation](https://salilab.org/saliweb/installation.html#outside-of-the-sali-lab).
