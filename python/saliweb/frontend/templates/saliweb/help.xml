<p>
This URL provides a REST-style interface to the Sali Lab's {{ config.SERVICE_NAME }}
web service. It is designed to be used for automated job submission
and collection of job results.
</p>

<p>
If you want to use the web interface for this service instead, please
open {{ config.URLTOP }} in a web browser.
</p>

<p>
To submit a job to the service, use the web_service.py tool available
at https://modbase.compbio.ucsf.edu/web_service.py
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, submit an HTTP POST request to
{{ url_for("job", _external=True) }}
and request XML output (e.g. by setting the HTTP Accept header
to "application/xml")
</p>

<p>
The POST data should be encoded as multipart/form-data and include the same
options and uploaded files that are submitted by the web interface. The service
will return a simple XML file that contains a URL for the completed job, which
will look like
{{ url_for("results", name="jobname", _external=True) }}
</p>

<p>
If an error occurs, a suitable HTTP status code will be set and the XML
file will contain a human-readable error string.
</p>

<p>
To retrieve job results, submit an HTTP GET request to the previously-obtained
URL. If the job is not yet complete an HTTP status code is returned; otherwise,
a simple XML file containing a list of the job's output files is returned.
Each output file is named with a URL of the form
{{ url_for("results_file", name="jobname", fp="outputfile", _external=True) }}
and the file itself can be obtained by a GET request to that URL.
