Configuration file
******************

The configuration file is used to store information used by the
:ref:`backend <backend>`, the
:ref:`frontend <frontend>`, and the build system. It is a fairly standard
'INI' file, containing
section titles in square brackets (e.g. [general]) and key-value pairs within
the sections, either of the form 'foo: bar' or 'foo = bar'.

The example file below defines the configuration for a fictional 'ModFoo'
service:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/example.conf

Each section in the configuration file is described below.

general
=======

admin_email
    The email address of the administrator of this web service. This is used
    to notify the admin if a job fails with a technical error or the entire
    web service encounters an unrecoverable error and cannot continue.

socket
    The full path to a socket file that is used for the frontend to send
    messages to the backend.

service_name
    The name of the service (human-readable). This is used in emails to the
    owners of jobs and the server admin, and as the title of web pages.

urltop
    The URL under which the service's web pages live. This is used to construct
    URLs containing job results, for example.

track_hostname
    If set to "True" then the hostname or IP address of each web service
    user is stored in the database.

github
    For web services that are open source and are hosted on GitHub, this should
    be filled in with the GitHub URL.

backend
=======

user
    The system user that the backend runs as. For security, robustness and
    easier monitoring, each web service has its own system user (e.g. the
    ModLoop web service runs as the 'modloop' system user). Note that the
    system user is distinct from the MySQL users set up to access the database.

state_file
    The full path to a file that is used by the backend to store state
    between calls. In normal operation this is simply used as a lock file to
    ensure that only one copy of the backend is running at a time. After an
    unrecoverable error, this file continues information on the nature of the
    failure and must be manually removed by the admin before the backend will
    run again.

check_minutes
    Typically, when new jobs are submitted the backend is notified and they
    start running immediately; once jobs are started the backend waits for
    them to finish and collects the results as soon as this happens. However,
    if a job is submitted from the frontend while the backend is not running,
    or the backend is restarted or the machine it is on is rebooted while jobs
    are running, the backend must fall back to a less efficient polling method
    to look for newly submitted or completed jobs. 'check_minutes' is the
    time, in minutes, to wait between checks for these jobs. An interval
    of 10 minutes is recommended. Note that archived and expired jobs are
    also checked for periodically, but this interval is fixed at 10% of the
    shorter of the archive and expiry times.

limits
======

running
    The maximum number of jobs that will run simultaneously. Defaults to 5.

concurrent_tasks
    The maximum number of tasks in each job that will run simultaneously.
    This is not enforced by the framework, but a service that runs a job on
    more than one machine can use this value to limit the parallelism.
    For example, services that run SGE array jobs can use this value to
    populate the `-tc` qsub parameter. Default is no limit.

database
========

db
    The name of the database in which the service's data are stored.

backend_config, frontend_config
    Filenames of additional INI files containing the MySQL username and
    password used by the backend and frontend to communicate with the database
    (in sections called [backend_db] and [frontend_db] respectively).
    (The frontend and backend should use different MySQL users, since they
    should have different access rights set up for the job tables.)
    If these filenames are not absolute paths, they are taken to be relative
    to the directory containing the main configuration file. The database
    authentication information has to stored in separate files so that file
    permissions can be set appropriately so that the frontend cannot read the
    backend configuration. An example backend.conf is shown below.

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/backend.conf

directories
===========

install
    The top-level directory in which the web service files are installed.

incoming, preprocessing, etc.
    Each :ref:`job state <jobstates>` except EXPIRED can be given a directory
    in which the job data are placed. Only the INCOMING and PREPROCESSING
    directories are required; others, if not specified, will default to the
    directory for the previous state (i.e. the RUNNING directory will default
    to that for PREPROCESSING, that for POSTPROCESSING will default to RUNNING,
    FINALIZING to POSTPROCESSING, COMPLETED to FINALIZING, and ARCHIVED
    to COMPLETED). If the FAILED directory is not given, it will default
    to the same as the COMPLETED directory.

oldjobs
=======

This section controls what happens to old jobs after they have completed.

archive
    Completed job results, after this time, will no longer be available for
    the end user to download from the frontend. The time is either NEVER to
    indicate that job results are available forever, or a number with a
    single character suffix (h for hours, d for days, w for weeks,
    m for months or y for years). For example, '90d' will archive job
    results after 90 days.

expire
    Completed job results will be deleted from disk after this time. Times are
    specified in the same way as for *archive*. Note that the *archive* time
    cannot be longer than the *expire* time.
