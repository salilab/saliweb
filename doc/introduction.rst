The Sali lab web framework aims to provide a simple set of classes and modules
to simplify the process of deploying a web service. It is designed for typical
Sali lab web applications - that is to say, jobs that are submitted from a
web interface but that then run on one or more cluster nodes for a possibly
long period of time.

Developers eager to get started may want to jump straight to :ref:`quick_start`.

The framework is split up into four distinct parts:

* The :ref:`frontend <frontend>` consists of HTML pages and Python scripts
  that provide a web interface to interact with an end user. It also provides an
  XML-based interface to allow automated submission of jobs. It handles the
  uploading of input files, the initial
  submission of jobs, displaying a queue of all jobs in the system, and
  showing the results of completed jobs. It can also potentially handle
  user logins.

* The :ref:`backend <backend>` is a set of Python classes that manages jobs
  after the initial submission. This typically runs as a daemon on our
  `modbase` machine, picking up submitted jobs from the frontend, submitting
  jobs to the cluster and gathering results, and doing any necessary pre- or
  post-processing.

* The :ref:`build system <build_system>` is a set of extensions to SCons that
  simplifies the procedure of deploying a a web service (initial setup,
  and installing everything in the correct locations and with the right
  permissions).

* *Monitoring* is typically set up by a sysadmin, and ensures that the
  web service, once set up and made available to end users, is correctly
  functioning.

The web framework stores all persistent data about the jobs in a MySQL database,
and configuration for the service is stored in a set of
:ref:`configuration files <configfile>` that are shared between all parts of
the framework.

The framework aims to be:

* *Comprehensive*: can handle simple services like ModLoop and complex
  services like CM-MR.

* *Robust*: full error checking is done at each step of the process;
  job failures are caught and reported to the server admin.

* *Extensible*: a service can be set up without user authentication,
  but this can be simply added in later. The backend Python classes provide
  multiple hooks to allow each step of the job to be modified.

* *Secure*: by default, file permissions should be set up sensibly. There
  should be no need for world-writeable directories or other hacks to allow
  files to be passed from the web server to the cluster. The backend runs as
  a different user from the web server, so it is unlikely that a bug in the
  frontend can be used to break into the cluster.

* *Efficient*: it is straightforward to configure the system so that
  long-term data from jobs are not left on expensive disks such as NetApp,
  but are instead moved to park disks or deleted.

* *Easy to use*: given a simple workflow, it should be easy to deploy a
  simple web server that implements it.
